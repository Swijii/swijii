## Swiji

I’m an **Algerian Composer & Sound Designer** passionate about immersive audio for indie games and media.  
Huge fan of **open-source software**, **privacy-first tools**, and **customizable UI themes**.  
I enjoy creating sounds that tell stories — from dark atmospheres to playful soundscapes — always aiming to enhance the player’s emotional experience.
